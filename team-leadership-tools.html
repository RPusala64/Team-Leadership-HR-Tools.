        <h2>📋 3-Day Onboarding Plan</h2>
        <p>This onboarding strategy aims to prepare IT team members on both technical and
            service awareness. It focuses on the early introduction to the central systems (e.g., Jira,
            Microsoft 365), a formalized escalation process, and such KPIs as First Contact Resolution
            Rate and Ticket Resolution Time. </p>

        <h2>🧭 RACI Chart</h2>
        <p>Patch management in a patching process is a high-impact and repetitive process in IT
            environments, where a RACI chart specifies strong ownership. Applying the concept of
            Responsible duties to technicians (e.g., Tier 2 Engineers), Accountability is delegated to the
            IT Supervisor to ensure deadlines are met and patching does not interfere with operations.
            DevOps and Security are among the stakeholders consulted regarding risk or testing (Buene
            & Fridtun, 2022)</p>

        <h2>🗓 PTO Tracker</h2>
        <p>A PTO Tracker helps IT supervisors anticipate tasks to be done and when they can be
            completed, ensuring consistent service levels even in the event of personnel absences. There
            is no monitoring of how leave overlap may clash with other support schedules or times that
            are sensitive to SLA. It is directly relevant to KPIs such as Ticket Resolution Rate and
            System Uptime, as both understaffing and its consequences, including the ticket backlog or
            SLA violation, must be avoided (Jackson, 2023).</p>

        <h2>⚠️ Warning Memo Template</h2>
        <p>This disciplinary memo promotes corrective communication by considering all
            employee violations in a highly professional and constructive manner. Reflecting on how
            incident templates and escalation protocols are used, as well as documenting behavior, will
            help maintain accountability and legal clarity. </p>
